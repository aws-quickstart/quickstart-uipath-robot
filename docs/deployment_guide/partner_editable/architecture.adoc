best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in private subnets.*
** A security group controlling inbound and outbound traffic to the bastion host instances.
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon EC2 instances to host UiPath Robot.
** A security group controlling inbound and outbound traffic to the UiRobot instances.
